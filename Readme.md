# Abba: A/B test analysis in Javascript

Abba is a Javascript library for A/B test analysis. It analyzes tests with binomial outcomes for any
number of groups. You can use the library (in `abba/`) to just compute statistics or to render a
nice table summarizing those statistics. There's a handy little app in `demo/` which demonstrates
how to use the library. You can find plenty more details in `demo/abba.html` or on the [live
demo](http://www.thumbtack.com/labs/abba).
