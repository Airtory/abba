# Abba: A/B test analysis in Javascript and Python

Abba is a library for A/B test analysis. It analyzes tests with binomial outcomes for any number of
groups. You can use the Javascript library (in `abba/`) to just compute statistics or to render a
nice table summarizing those statistics. There's a handy little app in `demo/` which demonstrates
how to use the library. There's a Python version under `python/`, also available on
[PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ABBA/).

You can find plenty more details on the [live demo](http://www.thumbtack.com/labs/abba).
