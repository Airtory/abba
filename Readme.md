# Abba: A/B test analysis in Javascript and Python

Abba is a library for A/B test analysis. It analyzes tests with binomial outcomes for any number of
groups. You can use the Javascript library (in `abba/`) to just compute statistics or to render a
nice table summarizing those statistics. There's a [handy little app][github-io-demo] in `demo/`
which demonstrates how to use the library. There's a Python version under `python/`, also available
on [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ABBA/).

~~You can find plenty more details on the [live demo](http://www.thumbtack.com/labs/abba).~~ *The
"live demo" page is temporarily down, but the detailed documentation is still there, and you can use
the [demo on github.io][github-io-demo] for computations. Sorry for the trouble.*
